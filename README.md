SAJaS, the Simple API for JADE-based Simulations, implements a
simplified version of many JADE features in a manner that makes
it possible to create faster JADE-like simulations, which don't
need or make use of JADE's distributed infractured.

In this first Alpha, we have sully implemented the Contract Net
and AchieveRE protocols, as well as other services needed to 
make them work.
